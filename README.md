# The Salon Members

A program that automatically does Memrise learning sessions for you. It will get you the target you need swiftly and efficiently.

---

**Important message** - use this ethically. Memrise is there to teach you a new language - whether it be for a subject or a hobby, at the end of the day, the only person you're cheating is _yourself_.

---

## How to use

1. Download the zip folder or clone via Git or GitHub CLI.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mjsandagi/the-salon-members.git
```

```bash
gh repo clone mjsandagi/the-salon-members
```

2. Install the required dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Make sure you are happy for Microsoft Edge to be used as your browser. If not, see line 69 in `app.py`, which has comments with further instructions.

4. Run the program

```
python app.py
```

-   It will ask you to enter your Memrise details (securely), and provide some additional information.

```
--------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to Salon Members. (Selenium - Memrise? Get it?)
--------------------------------------------------------
<insert information (just run the program and you'll see it)>
--------------------------------------------------------
Enter your Memrise username (with email):
Enter your Memrise password:
--------------------------------------------------------
```

5. The program will then open up an instance of your browser, with a banner saying `<browser> is being controlled by automated testing software`.
   Sit back and relax. You can use your computer as normal, but don't close the browser window.
